    # Building Height and Footprint

    Adds real-world building measurements to the Building Info panel in *Cities: Skylines II*.

    When selecting a building, this mod displays its estimated height, floor count, ground footprint, and elevation alongside the game’s existing information.

    ## Features

    - **Building height**
    - Displayed in feet or meters
    - Derived from actual 3D building geometry (natively in meters)

    - **Estimated floors**
    - Calculated using some adaptations based on building type and region pack. If you see any inaccuracies, please let me know.

    - **Building footprint**
    - Estimated ground area from geometry
    - Displayed as:
    - Acres (Imperial)
    - Hectares (Metric)
    - Approximate zoning cell dimensions for zoned buildings

    - **Building elevation**
    - Displayed in feet or meters
    - Adjustable offset in case you don't want to use the map's built in sea level value.

    Available under **Options → Building Height and Footprint**:

    - Height units: Feet or Meters
    (Footprint units switch automatically between acres and hectares)
